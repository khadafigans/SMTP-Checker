## ‚ú® Updated Features:
- ‚úÖ **All Features Use Proxy**
- ‚úÖ **Proxy List Support: You can provide a file with multiple proxies** (SOCKS5, HTTP, HTTPS, or just host:port for SOCKS5).
- ‚úÖ **The script will prompt for proxy use and the proxy list file.** (Random Proxy Selection per Request:)
- ‚úÖ **If a proxy fails (connection error, timeout, etc.), it is removed from the list and another is tried**
- ‚úÖ **All Previous Features Retained: (Advanced Shodan filters, country code support, randomized page order, deduplication, etc.)**
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Shodan Filters : You can add any Shodan search filter** (e.g., after:2024-01-01, port:8080, org:"Amazon.com", product:"Apache httpd", etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Country Code Support : You can specify one or more country codes (e.g., US,JP,DE) and the script will run separate searches for each country, saving results in separate folders. This helps you target specific regions.**
- ‚úÖ **Randomized Page Order: For each Shodan query, the script randomizes the order in which result pages are fetched. This helps you avoid always getting the same ‚Äútop‚Äù results and increases the diversity of your findings.**
- ‚úÖ **Deduplication : All results (hostnames and IPs) are stored in Python sets, which automatically remove duplicates. This ensures your output files contain only unique entries.**
- ‚úÖ **Large-scale Support : You can request up to 1,000,000 results per run, and the script will handle pagination and deduplication for large datasets**
